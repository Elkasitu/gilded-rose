# Gilded Rose

This repository is a fork of [this one](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) without all the unnecessary parts, Python only.

It is my solution to the exercise explained in the repository above.

## How to run

### Linux / OSX

Open a terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
python test_gilded_rose.py
```

### Windows

Download the CPython Interpreter, install it, open `test_gilded_rose.py` with IDLE and execute it.
